# For creating the database copy the "init-sqlserver-mydatabase.sql" and execute

USE DaABASE_NAME # FOR CHOOSING THE DATABASE
SELECT * # 
FROM TABLE_NAME # FROM WHICH TABLE DATA SHOULD QUERY, HERE FIRST 'FROM' WILL EXECUTE AFTER THAT 'SELECT' WILL

SQL Query language - For getting the data from DB, this query doesn't modify the data inside DB
We have different clauses in query language
SELECT - For Selecting Columns (* means selecting all columns), if we select the required columns the columns order will be our selection order and not DB Table order
    SELECT * (or) SELECT col1,col2 ...
From - FROM WHICH TABLE DATA SHOULD QUERY
    FROM Table_name
Where - Filtering the data based on our condition
    WHERE condition (<, >, !=, =, )
Orderby - Sorting the data (Ascending or Descending, Default is the Ascending)
    ORDERBY col_name ASC or DESC, nested sorting also can possible by selecting multiple columns (First selecting column executes first)
Groupby - For Aggregating the data, if we use Groupby the select column should have column corresponding to Groupby and Aggregation
    GROUPBY 
Having - For filtering the data after Aggregation
Distinct - To remove the duplicates from selected column
Top - For limiting the no.of rows
coding order and execution order of the clauses are different
SELECT, Distinct, Top, Where, Having are the data filtering clauses based on requirement

In Data Definition language, we are not retrieving the data. So after execution will get sucessful message instead of return data
DDL commnds are useful for mainain the structure of the database
CREATE - For creating the new Table
ADD or DROP Column (Altering) - While adding the Column will add at the end and not possible to alter the columns order once created, 
                                While creating and adding we should mention the data type
DROP - drop the table completely

In Data Manipulation language will Manipulate the data inside the existing table (empty or having data)
INSERTING - Inserting the data may be either adding data manually or querying the data from source table
            While Inserting manually if we not mention column names means values should be for all columns
            if we not select the all columns, SQL will consider NUll for unselected columns
UPDATE - Update the data in existing row data
         SET - For assigning values to columns
         WHERE - For selecting the row, other it will select all rows
DELETE - To delete the existing rows in a table
         FROM - To select the table
         Where - Slecting the row to delete

Where Operators are five types
Comparision Operators - Comparing the two columns (or) expression with value (or) function with value ...
                        (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
Logical Operators - AND (all conditions true), OR (at least one true), NOT (Excludes matching values)
Range Operators - BETWEEN (Check the value is within the Range or not like lower and upper boundary)
Membeship Operators - IN (Checks value in list), NOT IN (Opposite to IN)
Searhc Operators - LIKE (Searching for pattern in given text,'%':Anything (0,1 or many), '_':Exactly one)

Joins - For adding the columns (Should need key (common) column for joining)
Set Operators - For adding rows (Should need same no.of columns)
